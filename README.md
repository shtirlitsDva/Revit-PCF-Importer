This is a work in progress project.

2016.07.27 - Pipes import process is implemented. No interface yet. Fittings and accessories next in line.

**PCF Importer** is an add-in for [Autodesk Revit](http://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-family/overview) aimed to facilitate the import of piping data from PCF (Piping Component File) file format into Revit.

To get the most out of the program (in truth it is useless without knowledge of the format specification) it is strongly recommended to read the PCF reference guide which contains the format specifics. Please see [this](http://www.intergraph.com/assets/pressreleases/2015/05-12-2015.aspx) web page to obtain the specification of the PCF file format.
